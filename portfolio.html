          Hi I'm Jack Ashe, I've always found presentations like 'Hello, my name is blah blah, I have blah blah, 
          I am blah blah' boring, so I created this short film about me to introduce myself in a more original way, 
          I hope you enjoy watching it as much as I enjoyed making it.

        <p>
            I am a cinematographer, a storyteller through the lens. I capture fleeting moments and craft
             them into visual poetry, where light, shadow, and movement come together to evoke emotions. Through my camera, 
             I turn the ordinary into something extraordinary, using every frame to speak where words fall short. My work 
             is a blend of technique and artistry, constantly pushing boundaries to create stories that resonate long after
              the screen fades to black. 
        </p>
        <P>
          This is one of my work

        <h3><font color="grey">Professional Background</font></h3>
        <p>
          A seasoned cinematographer with over a decade of experience in visual storytelling, I have worked across a wide
          range of genres, from intimate dramas to expansive action films. With a background in both film studies and 
          hands-on production, I began my career in independent cinema, where I honed my skills in natural lighting, 
          composition, and the art of capturing emotion through the lens. My journey has taken me from set to set, 
          collaborating with directors, producers, and actors to bring stories to life with a unique visual style that 
          emphasizes both the grand and the subtle moments. I have worked internationally, adapting to diverse landscapes
          and cultural narratives, which has expanded my ability to create immersive worlds through camera work. Whether
          shooting on film or digital, I am committed to pushing the limits of what is possible, blending tradition 
          with innovation to create films that speak to the audience on a deeply emotional level
